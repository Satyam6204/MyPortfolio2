        <p className='text-xs md:text-xl lg:text-xl w-9/12 '>Hi, I'm Satyam Kumar, a passionate Full Stack Java Developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development.I recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Aravali Institute of Technical Studies, Udaipur, and a Diploma in Computer Science Engineering from Jai Polytechnic, Ambala.
          I have worked on several exciting projects, including building a TODO app, weather website, personal portfolio, and clones of popular platforms like Amazon and Udemy. These experiences have strengthened my skills in Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web technologies.

          I am currently undergoing a Full Stack Java Developer training program to further enhance my expertise. I believe in continuous learning and strive to stay up to date with the latest technologies in the ever-evolving tech industry.

          When I’m not coding, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and dancing—activities that help me stay creative and energized.

          Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss any potential opportunities!</p>
